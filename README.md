### create virtual environment

I used python of version 3.6 & tensorflow of version 2.5

conda create --name ror python=3.6

set up the environments by install pip , you should upgrade pip to the latest version to avoid potential errors: 

conda install -c anaconda pip

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

After setting the paths correctly, install all packages you need by install Requirements file

pip install -r Requirements.txt

### main file

import all library that you need
open data file
create many lists to save differents type in data file
when finish run main file 

python main.py
